        <p>A kitty cat. A daredevil.</p>
        <p>I'm Beau and I'm 3 years old. My mom got me from the <a href="https://lawrencehumane.org/">Lawrence Humane Society</a>.</p>
        <p>My favorite thing to do is birdwatch and find plastic to eat.</p>
        <p>I also like to sit on my mom's desk and watch her play on her light box.</p>
        <p>Sometimes typing on the lightbox is fun too, it clicks!</p>
        <p>At night, I like to sleep on her head because it's warm.</p>
        <p>This is a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaKzNtwPQxE">song</a> mom and I like listening to!</p>
        <p>One of my other favorite websites is <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple's</a> because the website's CSS is so visually aesthetic!</p>
